This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

When referencing specific sources in your response, use markdown footnotes to indicate which parts of the text come from which source. Use the following structure:
Add a footnote marker (e.g. [^1]) immediately after the relevant sentence or phrase.
At the end of the response, include a section titled **"## Sources"** (and **do not include a "## Footnotes" section**).
In the **Sources** section, list each source using this exact format:
[^1]: [name\_of\_the\_pdf](/benefitdocs/source_file#page=page_number)
If multiple sources are used, number them incrementally (\[^2], \[^3], etc.) and list each one on a new line.
⚠️ Important:
Do not modify the /benefitdocs/ path or the #page= fragment — they must remain exactly as shown.
Format links properly with square brackets \[ ] around the document name and parentheses ( ) around the URL.
Only include footnotes for sources that directly support your answer.
If your answer does not reference any specific source, do not include the **Sources** section.
