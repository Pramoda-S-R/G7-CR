<h1 align="center">🧙‍♂️ The Internship Chronicles</h1>
<p align="center"><em>“A Data Wizard’s Journey through the Realms of Machine Learning and Cloud”</em></p>

> _“In the fading age of ignorance, when data was raw and scattered, and insight but a whisper in the wind, there rose a seeker of patterns — one who would tame the storm of knowledge and forge models to divine the hidden truths of the world.”_

Thus began my journey — a wandering apprentice in the lands of Machine Learning, Cloud Sorcery, and the Art of the Prompt. What follows are the chronicles of my conquests.
