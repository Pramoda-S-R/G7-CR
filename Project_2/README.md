# üåç Emissions Forecasting and Trend Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting greenhouse gas emissions (N‚ÇÇO, CH‚ÇÑ, CO‚ÇÇeq) across various countries and regions. It leverages historical emissions data from agricultural and land-use activities to:

- Visualize long-term trends and change points
- Detect seasonality
- Forecast future emissions using multiple time series and machine learning models
- Compare emissions efficiency between countries

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **Notebook**: Contains all the data analysis, visualization, and forecasting logic.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists Python dependencies for running the notebook.
- **Data File**: `Emissions_Totals_E_All_Data.csv` (FAO dataset)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- Trend decomposition and seasonality detection
- Change point detection using `ruptures`
- Forecasting using:
  - ARIMA / SARIMA
  - Exponential Smoothing (ETS)
  - LSTM
  - XGBoost
  - Random Forest
  - Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
- Country-level comparative analysis (e.g., Uganda vs. Benin)
- Region-specific analysis (e.g., Southern Africa, Non-Annex I countries)

## üîß Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository**

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the Notebook**

Make sure the CSV file `Emissions_Totals_E_All_Data.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.

## üìä Example Analyses

- N‚ÇÇO emissions from synthetic fertilizer use in Bangladesh
- CH‚ÇÑ and N‚ÇÇO emissions from savanna fires in Southern Africa
- Relative emissions efficiency comparison (Uganda vs. Benin)
- Forecasts for countries with limited data (e.g., Sudan, Malawi)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Some countries or activities may lack sufficient data for accurate forecasting.
- Seasonal patterns are not modeled when data is annual.
