# **Project 2: Emissions Forecasting and Analysis**

## Problem Statement
The dataset provides emissions data related to agriculture, land use, waste management, and other activities across various countries and regions. The project involves leveraging the provided data to build forecasting models for different use cases, such as country-level emissions, regional emissions trends, and the impact of specific activities. The goal is to analyze historical data, identify patterns, and forecast emissions for the next decade.

## Tasks

### **1. Country-Level Emissions Forecast**
- **Problem Statement**:  
  The dataset provides data on emissions related to agriculture and land use for different countries. Using the `Area`, `Element`, and `Item` columns, predict the yearly emissions for a specific country. For example, predict emissions from **Synthetic Fertilizers (Item: 5061)** in **Bangladesh (Area: Bangladesh)**, where the `Element` is **Emissions (N2O)**. The `Unit` column indicates that the emissions are measured in kilotonnes (kt). The data spans multiple years and needs to be modeled to forecast emissions for the next 10 years.
- **Question**:  
  How can we predict the annual **N2O emissions** (from `Element: Emissions (N2O)`) caused by **synthetic fertilizers (Item: 5061)** in **Bangladesh (Area: Bangladesh)** for the next decade? What trends or seasonal patterns can be observed?

### **2. Regional Emissions Forecast by Activities**
- **Problem Statement**:  
  The dataset includes emissions data for regions like **Southern Africa (Area: Southern Africa)** and specific activities such as **Drained Organic Soils (Item: 67291)** and **Savanna Fires (Item: 6795)**. Using the `Area` and `Item` columns, aggregate emissions from all activities in a region, focusing on gases such as **N2O (Element: Emissions (N2O))** or **CH4 (Element: Emissions (CH4))**. Predict the total emissions for the next 5 years.
- **Question**:  
  What is the total yearly **N2O and CH4 emissions** (`Element: Emissions (N2O)` and `Element: Emissions (CH4)`) from activities like **Drained Organic Soils (Item: 67291)** and **Savanna Fires (Item: 6795)** in **Southern Africa (Area: Southern Africa)**? How can we forecast these emissions for the next 5 years?

### **3. Efficiency of Emissions on Agricultural Land**
- **Problem Statement**:  
  The dataset captures emissions related to agricultural land in various countries. For instance, **Uganda (Area: Uganda)** records emissions from **agricultural land (Item: 6995)** under `Element: Emissions (CO2eq) from N2O (AR5)`. Using the yearly data, calculate the efficiency of emissions per unit of agricultural land for multiple countries like **Uganda** and **Benin (Area: Benin)**. Forecast the efficiency trends for the next decade.
- **Question**:  
  How can we calculate and forecast the emissions efficiency (`Element: Emissions (CO2eq) from N2O (AR5)`) from **agricultural land (Item: 6995)** in countries like **Uganda (Area: Uganda)** and **Benin (Area: Benin)**? What are the trends over the next decade?

---

### **4. Global Trends in Waste-Related Emissions**
- **Problem Statement**:  
  The dataset provides emissions data from waste management activities for various countries and regions. For instance, **Waste (Item: 6818)** emissions are recorded in countries such as **Sudan (Area: Sudan)** and **Non-Annex I countries (Area: Non-Annex I countries)**. Using the `Element` column (e.g., `Emissions (CO2eq) from CH4 (AR5)`), analyze and predict global trends in emissions from waste for the next 10 years.
- **Question**:  
  What are the global trends in **waste-related emissions (Item: 6818 and Element: Emissions (CO2eq) from CH4 (AR5))** for countries like **Sudan (Area: Sudan)** and **Non-Annex I countries (Area: Non-Annex I countries)**? How can these emissions be forecasted for the next decade?

---

### **5. Impact of Forest Conversion on Regional Emissions**
- **Problem Statement**:  
  Emissions data related to forest conversion are provided for several regions and countries, such as **Net Forest Conversion (Item: 6750)** in **Malawi (Area: Malawi)** and **Afghanistan (Area: Afghanistan)**. The emissions data under `Element: Emissions (CO2eq) (AR5)` reflects the impact of land-use changes. Forecast the emissions caused by forest conversion in these areas for the next 10 years and analyze their contribution to total regional emissions.
- **Question**:  
  What is the impact of **Net Forest Conversion (Item: 6750)** on **CO2 equivalent emissions (`Element: Emissions (CO2eq) (AR5)`**) in regions such as **Malawi (Area: Malawi)** and **Afghanistan (Area: Afghanistan)**? How can these emissions be forecasted for the next 10 years?

## Deliverables
- Forecasting results for 5 different emissions-related use cases, with visualizations and a brief description of the trends observed from the forecasting. This includes identifying key patterns, seasonality, and potential changes in emissions over the predicted period.
