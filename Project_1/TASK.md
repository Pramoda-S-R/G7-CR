# **Project 1: Omega Healthcare Insurance Denial Prediction**

## Problem Statement
Predict whether an insurance claim will be denied or not based on the given real-world dataset.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Handling Imbalanced Datasets
- How can we address imbalance in the target column if the distribution is poor, and no additional data is available?
- What techniques can be applied to manage imbalanced distributions in other feature columns?
- After preprocessing and handling imbalance, how can a validation dataset be created and saved as a separate CSV file?

---

### 2. Model Training and Evaluation
- Train at least 7 different classification algorithms and compare their performance using metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC
- Using the confusion matrix, how can the best model be identified and justified?


---

### 3. ML Pipeline Developmenta
- How can an end-to-end machine learning pipeline be implemented for this problem?
- How can you create a Python class, `model_prediction`, that:
  - Accepts a test DataFrame as input.
  - Returns predictions for all the samples in the test data.

---

## Deliverables
- A clear strategy for handling imbalanced datasets.
- Training results for 7 different classification models, with performance comparison.
- An ML pipeline and a Python class for real-time predictions.
